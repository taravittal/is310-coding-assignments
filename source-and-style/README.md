## Assignment 1: Inspecting the Cultural Web

### Website
- Name: HathiTrust Digital Library  
- Link: https://www.hathitrust.org  

### What Technologies Does It Use?

After inspecting the HathiTrust website using the browser’s Developer Tools, I found that it uses

- HTML to structure the page such as headings, navigation, search bar, content sections, etc.
- CSS to control the design, including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, etc.
- JavaScript for the interactive elements like the search feature and navigation menus

### What I Saw in the Inspector

- Lots of `<div>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` elements in the HTML.
- Linked CSS files in the `<head>` section.
- JavaScript files ending in `.js` in the Sources and Network tabs.
- `.png` and `.svg` files for images and logos
- `.woff` and `.woff2` files for fonts

### Who Built It?

From the About page, HathiTrust is run by a partnership of major research libraries and institutions. It’s a collaborative digital repository, which means it is supported and maintained by a team, not just one person.

### GitHub Repository

I did not find a public GitHub repository for the main HathiTrust website.

### Contributors

There was not really a clear contributors page on HathiTrust. But, there was an About section that explains that they are supported by many partner institutions, which suggests that multiple developers and staff are involved in maintaining the platform.
