## Assignment 1: Inspecting the Cultural Web

### Website
- Name: HathiTrust Digital Library
- Link: https://www.hathitrust.org

### Technologies Used
When inspecting the HathiTrust website, I found evidence of the following web technologies:

- **HTML** – This structures the webpage content, such as headings, buttons, navigation menus, and text.
- **CSS** – Used to style the appearance of the page (fonts, layout, colors, spacing).
- **JavaScript** – Used for interactive elements like menus, search functionality, and dynamic page updates.

### Evidence from Inspecting
When using the browser Developer Tools (right-click → Inspect):

- I saw multiple HTML elements including `<div>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<form>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
- Linked CSS files were visible in the `<head>` section showing stylesheet `.css` links.
- JavaScript files (ending in `.js`) were visible in the “Sources” and “Network” tabs, indicating dynamic behavior like search boxes and menu toggles.
- Other file types included:
  - Images (`.png`, `.svg`) – used for logos and icons.
  - Font files (`.woff`, `.woff2`) – used for custom typography.
  - JSON data fetched via scripts.

### Who Built It / Who Maintains It?
- The website is maintained by the **HathiTrust Organization**, which is a partnership of major research institutions and libraries.
- HathiTrust is a collaborative repository for digitized books and cultural heritage materials.

### GitHub Repository (if found)
- A specific public GitHub repository for HathiTrust’s main site was **not found** during inspection.

### Contributors / How Many People Were Involved?
- While a specific public contributors page for the official website was not obvious, HathiTrust is supported and developed by many partner libraries with multiple staff roles.
- The HathiTrust blog and “About” pages indicate contributions from the HathiTrust Digital Library team.
